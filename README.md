# Visual Saliency Prediction Based on Cross-Stage Complementarity Enhancement
This repository contains PyTorch implementation of our visual saliency prediction model.
## Comparison
It is recommended to compare with our model by online benchmarks, such as  
[SALICON benchmark](http://salicon.net/challenge-2017/)  
[MIT300 benchmark](http://saliency.mit.edu/)
## Requirements:
cuda 11.0  
python 3.7  
pytorch 1.6.0  
The detailed environment dependencies is in requirements.yaml. You can easily copy the conda environment via conda env create -f requirements.yaml
